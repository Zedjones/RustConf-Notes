- Authentication vs Authorization
    - Authentication
        - Makes sure you are who you say you are
    - Authorization
        - Makes sure you are allowed to do something (permissions)
- PAM
    - Allows configuration of policies
    - Modules are for _changing_ passwords rather than the logic of using said passwords
- Tailscale can be used as an authentication layer
