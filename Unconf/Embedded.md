- Virtualization
- Lots of application w/ `no-std` that aren't necessarily what is traditionally thought of when hearing "embedded"
- Lots of considerations for making `no-std`-compatible crates
    - Tricky to make a crate that's both `std` and `no-std` compatible, lack of documentation
- ESP32 has good support
- Matician 
- How to encourage library devs to include `no-std` support
    - Make it more visible in the Rust book, etc. 
        - Section in the book for considerations
    - A lot of assumptions that new users already have embedded development experience
    - More guidance for library authors on how to use the feature gates, etc.
    - Library authors, however, do seem quite receptive to PRs that add support for `no-std`
    - Standardized location for embedded developers to communicate and share resouces, esp. with fragmentation of different hardware targets
- Better collation of resources that specify replacements for `std`/heap data types
- Resources
    - Embedded Rust book
        - However, it might be out-of-date since it was sponsored to be produced the first time
    - Ferris Systems
- Creation of more general Discord channel for all ranges of embedded
- `smoltcp` on STM32
    - Zero-copy library, very performant
- Not as many libraries in the embedded Rust world, but generally higher quality
- CAN library for Rust?
- `defmt` crates
    - Really efficient logging and testing framework
        - Can use `cargo run` and `cargo test`
- Better resources for setting up serial over USB
- `areweembeddedyet` idea
    - How well each platform is supported
- Is there a central place for embedded Rust users to congregate? 
    - If not, we should create one
    - Landing page for new users to find more specific communities
- Rust is in a unique position in the embedded ecosystem, in that we have a significant number of libraries that we can run on embedded platforms
    - Compared to C/C++
